## Features

### Admin Dashboard
- **Manage Cars**: Add, edit, and delete car details (name, brand, model, year, type, daily rent price, availability, image).
- **Manage Rentals**: View, create, update, and delete rental information (rental ID, customer details, car details, rental period, total cost, and status).
- **Manage Customers**: View and manage customer information (name, email, phone number, address, rental history).
- **Dashboard Statistics**: 
  - Total number of cars
  - Number of available cars
  - Total rentals
  - Total earnings from rentals

### Frontend (User Interface)
- **Browse Cars**: Users can filter cars by type, brand, and daily rent price.
- **Make Bookings**: Select a car, choose rental start and end dates, and confirm the booking if the car is available.
- **Manage Bookings**: Users can view their booking history and cancel upcoming bookings if the rental has not started yet.
- **Authentication**: Basic user authentication system (signup, login, logout). Middleware is used to protect routes for booking and viewing rental history.

### Email Notifications
- When a car is rented, both the customer and the admin receive emails with rental details.

### Technical Features
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admins can manage cars, rentals, and customers, while customers can only view and manage their own bookings.
- **No Payment Integration**: The system currently operates in "Cash On Delivery" mode.
